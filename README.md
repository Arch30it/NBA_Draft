NBA_Draft
==============================
The NBA draft is an annual event where teams pick players studying in American colleges and
from international professional leagues to join the rosters. These picked players based on
their statistics will be selected to play in the NBA league. The primary objective of the project
is to build a binary classification model which in turn when trained will help predict whether a
particular player based on his numbers will be drafted to get into the NBA.

The model built should first be used to train on the known data after which its performance
can be tested on the validation and testing, i.e. on the unseen data. The models can be
tuned on different hyperparameters based on the need. The metric we will use to assess the
performance of the model is the roc_auc_score, which basically computes the area under
the receiver operating characteristic curve from prediction scores.
